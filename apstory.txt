A Beagle and a Great Dane meet at a dog park. Their owners are happily strolling across the grass enjoying the sunny day.
These two dogs love to socialize. 
When the meet up, they pull their leashes going to meet each other. 
The owner, knowing their routine, give in and let them meet together. 
This time, they were not at a fire hydrant, which is a good thing.
 The Beagle says to the Great Dane, "How are you?" The Great Dane says, "Well. Do you want to hear a joke?" 
The owners do not understand. All the dogs are doing are sniffing each other.
 They shrug and give each other whatever looks.
 The Beagle says, "Okay". The Great Dane proceeds, "A hotdog and a bun meet up in a park. 
They come together and then run away." The Beagle stares and questions the joke.
 They the Beagle starts barking loudly as his owner stresses over it.
 The Beagle is not barking, he is laughing. The hotdog and bun was really a dachshund in the dog park. 
The Great Dane says "Goodbye, I need my date with a bright red fire hydrant".
 They walk away, giving relief to the owners. As they leave, the owner says each other,
 "We should have a barbeque". The end.
